# DeltaOMS - Getting Started

The following tutorial will guide you through the process for setting up the Delta Operational 
Metrics Store (DeltaOMS) on your Databricks Lakehouse environment.

You will deploy/configure the solution, configure a database/table for metrics collection, 
execute DeltaOMS to collate the metrics and finally run some 
sample analysis on the processed data.
